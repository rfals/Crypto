# Crypto Python project portfolio

The repository currently holds 2 projects, developed in Python. They utilize Object Oriented Programming, user defined functions, API's, custom packages, and more.

The projects were created for learning purposes and do not provide any financial advice.


## 1) Triple SMA

In this project I form a hypothesis based on historical market data trends and correlations. Then I develop a hypothesis and a trading strategy which is then back-tested, optimized, forward-tested and then finally using websockets and Binance API - implemented.

## 2) Triangle Arbitrage

In this project I develop a script for screening possible cross-pair arbitrage opportunities in Binance. The model is flexible and can be adjusted for differen rates of slippage and latency factors.
